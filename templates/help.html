            This web app was made with Flask (framework written with python), Bootstrap 4 and a MySQL database free hosted in <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/en/">Clever Cloud</a>. <br> 
            It just a personal project for my <a href="https://joacoviera.github.io/Portfolio/">Personal Portfolio</a>. <br>
            You don't have to use a valid email to sign up, with somthing like name@email.com it's fine. <br> 
            If you don't want to sign in you can use the user and password <strong>root root</strong> or <strong>user user</strong>. <br>
            Of course the project contains many bugs, I'm working on it. <br>
            Feel free to use it and contribute :) <br> <br>
